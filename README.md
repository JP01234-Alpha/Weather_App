# Weather_App

A weather app built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a web application that uses APIs to fetch real-time weather data and presents it in an easy-to-read format. 
The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, while the JavaScript code handles data retrieval and presentation. The weather app provides current weather conditions, such as temperature for a given location. Users can search for weather data by entering a city name.
